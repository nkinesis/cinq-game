# CINQ
This is a Java game I made in 2014, one of the first things I ever coded in Java (therefore, bear in mind the code might not be great, I got a lot better since then). While I don't intend to improve it, I decided to keep it here as a nice memory and also as an example of a simple (but slightly challenging) project for Java beginners.

## Game overview
In this project, I used Java Swing to create a game in the same style of [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)): the player sees a sequence of randomly generated numbers and attempts to memorize them. The sequence then disappears and the players must input it in a text box. If the player inputs the sequence correctly, they win.

## Setup
You will need Java 1.7 and Netbeans to run this project.
