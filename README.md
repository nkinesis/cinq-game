# CINQ
This is a Java game I made in 2014, one of the first things I ever coded in Java (therefore, bear in mind the code might not be great, I got a lot better since then). 

## Game overview
In this project, I used Java Swing to create a game in the same style of Simon[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)]: the player sees a sequence of randomly generated numbers and attempts to memorize them. The sequence then disappears and the players must input it in a text box. If the player inputs the sequence correctly, they win.

## Setup
You need Netbeans to run this project.
